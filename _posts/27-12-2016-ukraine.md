A story about doctors, who devoted themself to volunteering on the Ukrainian East
“Patriotism motivated us to be volunteers. Five years ago no one thought about volunteering, but now it saves our country,” Vladyslav Horbovets, a volunteer at the Pyrogov First Volunteer Mobile Hospital says about his motivation to be a medical volunteer on the Ukrainian East.
The Pyrogov First Volunteer Mobile Hospital was created more than two years ago in the midst of severe battles on the East, when the need for the doctors and nurses was high. It joined dozens of Ukrainian volunteer organizations who have been helping Army since then.
Dozens of death everyday because of the lack of medicaments and doctors. This how bad situation was. Today, many Ukrainians believe that volunteers saved many lives and they “sew” Ukraine. Two of them — Vladyslav Horbovets and Alina Naragan — joined the Pyrogov in 2015. They worked together quite a long time and helped hundreads of soldiers and civilians to recover.
